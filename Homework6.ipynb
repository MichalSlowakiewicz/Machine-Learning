        "---------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will explore three common formulations of the splitting criterion used in **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** for **regression problems**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Local RSS Minimization**  \n",
        "2. **RSS Gain Maximization**  \n",
        "3. **Total RSS Minimization**\n",
        "\n",
        "You will investigate whether any of these criteria are equivalent, and you will design an experiment to determine which criterion is actually employed in a standard implementation such as **scikit-learn’s DecisionTreeRegressor**.\n",

        "\n",
        "## **The Problem**\n",
        "\n",
        "Many treatments of CART for regression describe the split selection process in different ways. Below are three frequently cited formulations. Suppose we have a dataset with features $X$ and target $y$, and we seek to choose a feature $X_j$ and a threshold $t$ to split the data into two regions $R_1(X_j, t)$ and $R_2(X_j, t)$. Denote by $\\bar{y}_{R_m}$ the mean of targets within region $R_m$.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Local RSS Minimization**  \n",
        "   We select the feature and threshold that minimize the **sum of squared errors** in the two resulting child nodes:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   (X_j^*, t^*) = \\arg\\min_{X_j, t} \\sum_{m=1}^{2} \\sum_{i : x_i \\in R_m(X_j, t)} (y_i - \\bar{y}_{R_m})^2.\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **RSS Gain Maximization**  \n",
        "\n",
        "   It is also a local method, looking only at a parent and two child nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "   We select the feature and threshold that maximize the **reduction** in RSS, computed by subtracting the RSS of the two child nodes from the RSS in the parent node:\n",

        "\n",
        "   For any split on feature $X_j$ at threshold $t$, define $T(X_j, t)$ as the new tree obtained by splitting one leaf of $T$ into two leaves $R_1(X_j, t)$ and $R_2(X_j, t)$.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Let $\\mathrm{Leaves}(T(X_j, t))$ be the set of all leaf indices in this new tree. For each leaf $m \\in \\mathrm{Leaves}(T(X_j, t))$, define:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   R_m = \\{\\, i \\,\\mid\\, x_i \\text{ ends in leaf } m\\}.\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "   $R_m$ set collects all data indices $i$ whose feature vector $x_i$ is classified into the leaf node $m$ when passed through the tree $T(X_j,t)$. In other words, each leaf node $m$ in $T(X_j, t)$ corresponds to a unique path of splits, and any data point $x_i$ that follows that path is assigned to the leaf $m$; hence, it belongs to $R_m$.\n",
        "\n",
        "   $R_m$ sets for all leafs $m \\in \\mathrm{Leaves}(T(X_j, t))$ define a partition of all indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Then the objective of **minimizing total Residual Sum of Squares (total RSS)** is stated as:\n",
        "   $$\n",

        "   - Create a small artificial dataset and train a `DecisionTreeRegressor` from `scikit-learn`.\n",
        "   - The dataset must be designed in a way that uniquely identifies the formulation used. Provide a short code snippet and a plot or table to support your conclusion.\n",

        "   - Summarize your theoretical insights and empirical findings in a **Colab notebook**.\n",
        "   - Include the relevant proofs, code, discussion, and conclusions.\n",
        "   - Place the notebook in your **GitHub repository** for this course, add a link to it in your README.md and add an **“Open in Colab”** badge in the notebook so it can be launched directly.\n",
